Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for Irakli Matcharashvili's project in Educational and Psychological Measurement. The project focuses on the internal structure of a test, identifying subconstructs related to Health Anxiety Levels (HAL), Cognitive Performance Levels (CPL), Emotional Well-being Levels (EWL), and Physiological Wellness Levels (PWL).

Project Components
1. Theory and Factor Analytic Diagram
Irakli identified subconstructs and created a factor analytic diagram to represent the internal structure of the test. The identified subconstructs and associated items are detailed in the project documentation.

2. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)
The CFA results are as follows:

χ² = 278.532; df = 113; p = 0.000
CFI = 0.961
TLI = 0.953
RMSEA = 0.060 (90% CI: 0.051 - 0.069)
These fit indices indicate a good fit of the proposed model to the data. The Chi-square statistic suggests that the model does not fit the data perfectly, but the other fit indices support the overall model validity.

3. Factor Loadings and Correlations
The factor loadings with standard errors are provided for all items (n=403). Additionally, correlations between factors, their directions, and magnitudes are detailed in the documentation.

4. APA Write-up
An APA-style write-up is included, summarizing the CFA results, factor loadings, and correlations. Salient indicators for each factor are highlighted, along with interpretations of the correlations between factors.

5. Appendices
Appendix 1 contains the questionnaire used in the study, and Appendix 2 includes the R script used for analysis.
